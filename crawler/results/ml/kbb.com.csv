Available as a stylish 4-door sedan or a versatile 5-door <a href=""/hatchback/"" alt_o_t=""Category"">hatchback</a>, the new Mazda3 offers impressive standard features, many tech-based active safety systems and a refined interior. Three trim levels are available, Sport, Touring and Grand Touring. Sport models are powered by a 155-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, while the Touring and Grand Touring get a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that produces 184 horsepower. A 6-speed manual is standard but a far more popular 6-speed automatic transmission is available. Some of the Mazda’s rivals in the crowded compact segment are the <a href=""/honda/civic/"" alt_o_t=""Make Model"">Honda Civic</a>, VW Golf and Jetta, <a href=""/toyota/corolla/"" alt_o_t=""Make Model"">Toyota Corolla</a>, <a href=""/ford/focus/"" alt_o_t=""Make Model"">Ford Focus</a>, Chevy Cruze and <a href=""/subaru/impreza/"" alt_o_t=""Make Model"">Subaru Impreza</a>.</p></div>

The 2.5-liter found in the Touring and top-tier Grand Touring variants, cranks out 184 horsepower. While the 2.0-liter is a capable performer, it trades a measure of enthusiasm for better fuel economy -- 37-mpg highway and 28-mpg city with the 6-speed automatic transmission, which costs $1,050. The 2.5-liter won’t stretch a gallon of gasoline quite as far, but it’s close and notably amps up the car’s sporting character. Both engines are smooth, vivacious and they like to rev. Manual-transmission lovers will appreciate that Mazda offers an excellent 6-speed manual in both body styles, and with both engines. All Mazda3 models are front-wheel drive.<br>

				""reviewBody"": ""Playful and sophisticated, the 2018 Mazda3 is a fuel-efficient compact that’s one of the most fun-to-drive cars in its class. Available as a stylish 4-door sedan or a versatile 5-door hatchback, the new Mazda3 offers impressive standard features, many tech-based active safety systems and a refined interior. Three trim levels are available, Sport, Touring and Grand Touring. Sport models are powered by a 155-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder, while the Touring and Grand Touring get a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that produces 184 horsepower. A 6-speed manual is standard but a far more popular 6-speed automatic transmission is available. Some of the Mazda’s rivals in the crowded compact segment are the Honda Civic, VW Golf and Jetta, Toyota Corolla, Ford Focus, Chevy Cruze and Subaru Impreza.If you want more than four wheels and a steering wheel. If you want to like your car. If you want to want your car. If you want to feel something when you drive your car. If you believe life is too short to drive an ugly car you’ll like the 2018 Mazda3.
If you’re looking for all-wheel drive, check out Mazda’s CX-3 crossover SUV or shop Subaru’s Impreza. If have to have over 200 horsepower, the turbocharged VW GTI, Ford Focus ST and Honda Civic Si have the Mazda3 covered. The Civic also offers much more rear-seat legroom than the Mazda.For 2018 the Mazda3 receives minor but significant updates. The 2.0-liter engine is no longer available in the Touring trim level. Touring models are now powered by the 2.5-liter also used in the Grand Touring. Also, Mazda’s Smart City Brake Support system is now standard on the Sport model.
Thanks to Mazda’s innovative Skyactiv powertrain and chassis design, the 2018 Mazda3 is both fun to drive and fuel-efficient.

The Touring and Grand Touring’s 2.5-liter engine offers a bit more power with only a few miles-per-gallon sacrifice at the pump.
TOP SAFETY PICK+  The Mazda3 may be Mazda’s smallest and least expensive model, but it has received the highest safety ratings for crash impact by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The Mazda3 earned 5 Stars from NHTSA and a rating of Top Safety Pick+ from IIHS.    &amp;nbsp;VERSATILE HATCHBACK BODY STYLE  Many compacts are only available as 4-door sedans, but the sportier hatchback body style has made a recent resurgence in this class. The Mazda3 hatchback has one of the largest cargo volumes in the segment, 20.2 cubic feet of space behind the back seat and 47.1 cubic feet with the seats folded.  This is one of the best interiors in this class. The Mazda3’s cabin is warm and refined, with an upscale, expensive look and feel. All models feature a large 7-inch screen on the dash. It looks like a tablet, but it’s not a touch screen.

                The 2018 toyota camry electric vehicle qualifies for a federal tax credit of up to $7,500, effectively reducing the net base price.<br />
                <ul>
                    Depending on your city or state, other electric vehicle-related perks may include:
                    <li><span class=""bullet"">•</span> additional purchase incentives</li>
                    <li><span class=""bullet"">•</span> single-occupant access to carpool lanes</li>

                <br />
                Home charging stations, which cut charging times in half (or more) vs. standard wall outlets, may also be eligible for incentives. Find more incentive information at  <a class=""link js-fuelecon"" href=""http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxphevb.shtml"" target=""_blank"">

Given Toyota's massive success with the Prius hybrid, it's no surprise the latest gasoline-electric Camry Hybrid is better than ever. The new version has a fuel-economy rating of up to 53 mpg, packs more power than the standard 4-cylinder model and is satisfying to drive. It's the best of all worlds.<br>
<br>
TOYOTA SAFETY SENSE P (TSS-P)<br>
The 2018 Camry has an impressive suite of safety and driving aids. More impressive is that it's standard. Even the lowest-priced model has dynamic radar cruise control, the ability to detect pedestrians or objects and apply the brakes, keep the vehicle from drifting in lanes and automatically adjust the high beams.<br>

From front to back, the new Camry aims to show off its newfound athleticism and attitude. Its large front grille is hard to miss, and the Camry's new, 1.6-inch-lower aluminum hood shows off interesting creases.

			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>The 2018 Camry’s lineup consists of L, LE, SE, XSE and XLE, with SE and XSE the sportier pair. The least expensive 2018 Toyota Camry L is a solid buy that includes automatic transmission, 6-way-manually adjustable front seats, the TSS-P suite of safety and driving aids, and an infotainment system that bundles a rearview camera and 6-speaker AM/FM audio system with Bluetooth and USB/auxiliary inputs. For $500 more, we recommend the LE as it includes a power driver's seat, 60/40-split folding rear seats, alarm system and 17-inch alloy wheels. Toyota Care (two years/25,000 miles of complimentary maintenance and 24/7 roadside assistance) is standard.</p>

			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>Three powertrains remain available, and all have been revamped. Most popular is the standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that now boasts 203 horsepower (206 in XSE models) and earns up to 41 mpg. The most powerful Camry is the V6, now packing 301 horsepower. Both of those engines are mated to a new 8-speed automatic transmission. The 2018 Camry Hybrid pairs a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine and a battery-powered electric motor for enviable fuel economy of up to 53 mpg. Camry Hybrid LE models actually use a pricier lithium-ion pack, while the higher-trim Camry Hybrid SE and XLE variants use a nickel-metal hydride battery. Toyota reps say the rational for this has to do with fuel-efficiency goals and pricing strategy. All Camrys are front-wheel drive.<br>

			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p style=""text-align: center;"">The 2018 Toyota Camry has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $24,380, including destination charge. For just $505 more, we recommend the better-equipped LE model. The sportier Camry SE bows at just over $26,000, while the very well-equipped XLE and XSE trims start just under $30,000. The V6 Camry, only available in XLE and XSE trim, begins over $35,000, and the new Hybrid is $28,685. At these prices, the Camry is in line with a comparably equipped Honda Accord. The Camry's starting price is slightly higher than those of the Nissan Altima, Hyundai Sonata, Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Fusion, Mazda6, Kia Optima and all-wheel-drive Subaru Legacy. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their Toyota Camry. The Camry's resale value is another bright spot, as Toyota's midsize sedan has historically held its value at or near the top of its class.<br>

The least expensive 2018 Toyota Camry L is a solid buy that includes automatic transmission, 6-way-manually adjustable front seats, the TSS-P suite of safety and driving aids, and an infotainment system that bundles a rearview camera and 6-speaker AM/FM audio system with Bluetooth and USB/auxiliary inputs. For $500 more, we recommend the LE as it includes a power driver&#39;s seat, 60/40-split folding rear seats, alarm system and 17-inch alloy wheels. Toyota Care (two years/25,000 miles of complimentary maintenance and 24/7 roadside assistance) is standard.
SE models have sportier exterior aesthetics, 18-inch wheels, paddle shifters, sport front seats and sport-tuned suspension. XSE and XLE models have dual-zone climate control, 7-inch configurable instrument display and 8-inch central touch screen, leather seats, selectable drive modes (Eco, Normal, Sport), blind-spot monitoring, panoramic glass roof with moonroof, and electric parking brake. Among the various options are JBL premium audio system with navigation, bird&#39;s-eye camera, Qi-compatible wireless phone-charging cradle and head-up display. The standard Entune 3.0 infotainment system has built-in Wi-Fi, and while it lacks CarPlay or Android Auto integration, it does offer Siri Eyes Free and Google voice control.Three powertrains remain available, and all have been revamped. Most popular is the standard 2.5-liter 4-cylinder that now boasts 203 horsepower (206 in XSE models) and earns up to 41 mpg. The most powerful Camry is the V6, now packing 301 horsepower. Both of those engines are mated to a new 8-speed automatic transmission. The 2018 Camry Hybrid pairs a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine and a battery-powered electric motor for enviable fuel economy of up to 53 mpg. Camry Hybrid LE models actually use a pricier lithium-ion pack, while the higher-trim Camry Hybrid SE and XLE variants use a nickel-metal hydride battery. Toyota reps say the rational for this has to do with fuel-efficiency goals and pricing strategy. All Camrys are front-wheel drive.

The 2018 Toyota Camry has a Manufacturer&#39;s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $24,380, including destination charge. For just $505 more, we recommend the better-equipped LE model. The sportier Camry SE bows at just over $26,000, while the very well-equipped XLE and XSE trims start just under $30,000. The V6 Camry, only available in XLE and XSE trim, begins over $35,000, and the new Hybrid is $28,685. At these prices, the Camry is in line with a comparably equipped Honda Accord. The Camry&#39;s starting price is slightly higher than those of the Nissan Altima, Hyundai Sonata, Chevrolet Malibu, Ford Fusion, Mazda6, Kia Optima and all-wheel-drive Subaru Legacy. Before buying, check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their Toyota Camry. The Camry&#39;s resale value is another bright spot, as Toyota&#39;s midsize sedan has historically held its value at or near the top of its class.

            <p class=""paragraph-two"">
                The 2019 toyota corolla electric vehicle qualifies for a federal tax credit of up to $7,500, effectively reducing the net base price.<br />
                <ul>
                    Depending on your city or state, other electric vehicle-related perks may include:
                    <li><span class=""bullet"">•</span> additional purchase incentives</li>
                    <li><span class=""bullet"">•</span> single-occupant access to carpool lanes</li>
                    <li><span class=""bullet"">•</span> free or discounted parking</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                Home charging stations, which cut charging times in half (or more) vs. standard wall outlets, may also be eligible for incentives. Find more incentive information at  <a class=""link js-fuelecon"" href=""http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxphevb.shtml"" target=""_blank"">

					<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>The Corolla has long been one of Toyota's most popular models -- indeed, one of the world's best-sellers -- and it has continued to find a place in an American market that has rapidly shifted from sedans to SUVs and crossover SUVs. To help maintain momentum, Toyota is introducing a 2-door Corolla Hatchback for 2019, but that car is all-new, completely different, and reviewed separately. But the 4-door Corolla goes into the new model-year entirely unchanged. It still has plenty to win over buyers, including an attractive design, a comfortable and reasonably roomy interior and lots of features for the money, particularly when it comes to the standard Toyota Safety Sense package including an impressive list of standard features such as pre-collision warning and adaptive cruise control.&nbsp;</p>

			<h3 class=""full-expert-review-section-header"">Driving Impressions</h3>
			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>While there's plenty to like about the Toyota Corolla, it is not the car for folks who want aggressive driving dynamics. It offers what often is called a &quot;boulevard ride.&quot; For those who aren't looking to take corners hard, however, that's a definite plus. The Corolla offers a smooth ride that is comfortable over long drives. It doesn't wallow, however, and the current model has much more responsive steering than earlier versions of the sedan. The base engine, a 132-horsepower 1.8-liter inline-4, has reasonable power, but the upgraded LE Eco takes that up to 140 horsepower. Acceleration is on the low end of the compact spectrum, especially compared to the likes of the latest Civic or Mazda3. Meanwhile, cabin noise is relatively low, except when you're pushing the pedal to the floor.</p>

The Corolla LE Eco offers a 140-horsepower version of the same engine, but it's no hot-rod, instead being tuned for better fuel economy. Fuel economy is good, especially with the Eco getting up to 40 mpg on the highway, but these days that's par for the course instead of class-leading.

					<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>The 2019 Volkswagen Jetta is marking its fourth decade in existence in all-new form this year. Now in its seventh generation, VW’s 5-passenger compact sedan returns with crisp design, enhanced safety and driver-assist features, and fresh technology. Also attractive is its starting price. Starting under $20,000, it’s competitive with rivals like the Honda Civic, Chevy Cruze, and Nissan Sentra. Those competitors – and just about every other small sedan – outsell the Jetta, but it’s not for lack of appeal. As the only mainstream European compact sedan on the market, the 2019 Jetta boasts zesty driving manners and contemporary design, all while hiding a few tricks up its sleeve. A higher-power Jetta GLI waits in the wings, but until then, this new model only offers one engine choice.</p>

			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>The Volkswagen Jetta is all-new for 2019. Now in its seventh generation and marking 40 years in production, VW’s small sedan returns with slightly larger dimensions, enhanced technology that includes standard Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration, and available driver-assist features like adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring and automatic emergency braking. The sportier Jetta R-Line is a first for the model.</p>

			<h3 class=""full-expert-review-title"">Driving It</h3>
					<div class=""full-expert-review-section"">
			<h3 class=""full-expert-review-section-header"">Driving Impressions</h3>
			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>The 2019 VW Jetta has lost a couple of things in its current form vs. the 2018 model, but the good news is, it’s still a nimble driver. In the missing column is the option for a higher-powered (170 horsepower) 1.8-liter engine, and a multilink rear suspension. For 2019, the Jetta is only offered with a 147-horsepower 1.4-liter turbocharged engine, while the former suspension has been swapped for a simpler torsion beam. Despite this, the new Jetta feels lively and agile. Acceleration is peppy, especially in Sport mode, and the handling retains the European feel that has been associated with the Jetta for decades. By “European feel,” we mean that it is both agile and fun in corners while, still proving a taut yet comfortable ride on the highway. The new 8-speed automatic transmission is a high point. Shifts are smooth, and the system eagerly kicks down gears when needed, such as for high-speed passing. Manual transmission fans take note: The new 6-speed is a joy to use. It’s easy, light and engaging. The downside is it’s only offered on the base Jetta S.</p>

				""reviewBody"": ""The 2019 Volkswagen Jetta is marking its fourth decade in existence in all-new form this year. Now in its seventh generation, VW’s 5-passenger compact sedan returns with crisp design, enhanced safety and driver-assist features, and fresh technology. Also attractive is its starting price. Starting under $20,000, it’s competitive with rivals like the Honda Civic, Chevy Cruze, and Nissan Sentra. Those competitors – and just about every other small sedan – outsell the Jetta, but it’s not for lack of appeal. As the only mainstream European compact sedan on the market, the 2019 Jetta boasts zesty driving manners and contemporary design, all while hiding a few tricks up its sleeve. A higher-power Jetta GLI waits in the wings, but until then, this new model only offers one engine choice.
If you want a small sedan with taut yet comfortable driving manners and noteworthy tech that includes standard Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration, the 2019 VW Jetta is worth a look. Volkswagen&#39;s impressive 6-year/72,000-mile transferable, bumper-to-bumper warranty also helps the Jetta stand out.
Rivals ranging from the Honda Civic to Mazda3 offer similarly fun driving manners and more engine choices, plus hatchback variants. The Hyundai Elantra and Kia Forte also have standout warranties that cover 10 years/100,000 miles for the powertrain.
The Volkswagen Jetta is all-new for 2019. Now in its seventh generation and marking 40 years in production, VW’s small sedan returns with slightly larger dimensions, enhanced technology that includes standard Apple CarPlay/Android Auto integration, and available driver-assist features like adaptive cruise control, blind-spot monitoring and automatic emergency braking. The sportier Jetta R-Line is a first for the model.
The 2019 VW Jetta has lost a couple of things in its current form vs. the 2018 model, but the good news is, it’s still a nimble driver. In the missing column is the option for a higher-powered (170 horsepower) 1.8-liter engine, and a multilink rear suspension. For 2019, the Jetta is only offered with a 147-horsepower 1.4-liter turbocharged engine, while the former suspension has been swapped for a simpler torsion beam. Despite this, the new Jetta feels lively and agile. Acceleration is peppy, especially in Sport mode, and the handling retains the European feel that has been associated with the Jetta for decades. By “European feel,” we mean that it is both agile and fun in corners while, still proving a taut yet comfortable ride on the highway. The new 8-speed automatic transmission is a high point. Shifts are smooth, and the system eagerly kicks down gears when needed, such as for high-speed passing. Manual transmission fans take note: The new 6-speed is a joy to use. It’s easy, light and engaging. The downside is it’s only offered on the base Jetta S.
DIGITAL COCKPIT 
Call it trickle-down technology. This digital dashboard that debuted on VW’s luxury-brand cousin, Audi, a few years ago can now be had on a mainstream Jetta. It replaces the traditional gauges with a slick, 10.25-inch configurable screen that can display navigation maps, audio info, and, of course, speed/rpm data. 
 
BEATS AUDIO 
In another first for the Jetta, Volkswagen has partnered with Beats Audio for its premium sound system. While some of Beats’ previous systems were bass-heavy, this new setup sounds more refined and pleasing across the entire frequency spectrum.
The 2019 Jetta’s 5-passenger cabin retains its clean Euro simplicity. Controls for audio, climate and the like are kept to a minimum and are easy to see and reach. All 2019 Jetta models feature a central touch screen that handles infotainment. Lower trims use a 6.5-inch display, while higher ones have a better-looking 8-inch unit.

					<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>One of the best-selling sedans in America just got a major overhaul and wow, does it look good. The 2018 Honda Accord banishes the cautious styling of previous generations in favor of a racy coupe-like silhouette, which is good because Honda just killed off the Accord Coupe. A new set of turbocharged 4-cylinder engines replace the previous 4- and 6-cylinder engines, allowing Honda engineers to give the Accord a lower, wider stance. The new Accord’s longer wheelbase improves rear-seat space, so much so that a rear-facing child seat can now fit securely without hitting the front seatback. Honda Sensing brings more standard driver-assist features than are offered with the Toyota Camry, giving the Ohio-built Accord a slight advantage over its longtime nemesis.</p>

			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>The 2018 Honda Accord expresses itself differently depending upon trim level. The standard 192-horsepower 1.5-liter engine offers strong off-the-line performance and acceptable levels of power for passing and merging, but the biggest advantage is its class-leading 33-mpg combined fuel-economy figure. Moving up to the 2.0-liter turbo brings a more robust response, with 252 horsepower and 273 lb-ft of torque available as low as 2,200 rpm. We spent a good deal of time in the Touring trim outfitted with the 2.0-liter and the Adaptive Damper System. This engine is mated to a new 10-speed automatic transmission, which we generally liked, but did notice a bit of hesitation in some passing maneuvers, followed by a slight shudder. The adaptive dampers did a good a job helping the Accord round corners with confidence, but also rendered the big Honda more susceptible to road distortion and freeway expansion joints.

The result is a very seductive looking Accord that only gets better looking as you move up the trims. The Sport wears 19-inch black-and-chrome alloy wheels, LED fog lights and a rear spoiler, while Touring trims get full-LED headlights, adaptive dampers, and front and rear parking sensors.

Moving up to the Sport trim brings the option of the 2.0-liter engine and manual transmission as well as standard 8-inch display audio, Sport combi seats, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, a 12-way power driver’s seat, 60/40 split rear seat, and more.<b></b></p>

The EX-L includes leather seats, a 450-watt audio system, and a 4-way power passenger seat. The Touring trim adds navigation (optional on the EX-L), full-LED headlights, head-up display, wireless phone charging, HondaLink Assist, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, rain-sensing wipers, and front and rear parking sensors. Hybrid models pretty much match their non-hybrid counterparts, although there is no Sport trim.</p>

			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>Honda’s Accord sedan for 2018 offers a choice of two turbocharged 4-cylinder engines. Standard is the 1.5-liter turbo good for 192 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque, a 7-horsepower improvement over last year’s 2.4-liter engine. Optional on the Sport, EX and Touring is a 2.0-liter turbo pumping out 252 horsepower, a noticeable loss of 26 horsepower over the previous 3.5-liter V6. However, the 2.0-liter brings an additional 21 lb-ft of torque to the table, all of which is available at a much lower rpm. All trims with the 1.5-liter engine are mated to a CVT automatic transmission, with the exception of the Sport which offers a 6-speed manual option. The 2.0-liter is paired with Honda’s new 10-speed automatic, again the only exception being the Sport 2.0’s 6-speed manual gearbox. The 2018 Accord Hybrid employs the previous generation’s 2.0-liter gasoline engine and electric-motor setup, as well as the CVT transmission.<br>

			<h3 class=""full-expert-review-section-header"">Pricing Notes</h3>
			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p style=""text-align: center;"">The 2018 Honda Accord LX has a base manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) starting at $24,445 including the $875 destination fee. The Sport 1.5 starts at $26,655 with either the manual or CVT transmission. The EX bumps the sticker to $28,345, while the Touring with the 1.5-liter engine tops out at $34,675. Add the 2.0-liter engine to the mix and the Sport jumps to $31,185, the EX-L to $32,845, and the Touring to $36,675. The new Honda Accord Hybrid also spans five trims, opening at $25,990 for a base model and rising to $35,600 for a Touring version. The Accord’s pricing is right in line with a comparably equipped Toyota Camry, Ford Fusion, Kia Optima and Chevrolet Malibu, and about $2,000 less than a comparably equipped all-wheel drive Subaru Legacy with EyeSight driver assist. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid. As for resale, it’s too soon to give accurate figures, but it's safe to say the new Accord will likely retain its excellent 5-year values on par with the Toyota Camry and ahead of just about every other midsize sedan.<br>

The 2018 Accord comes in five trims: LX, Sport, EX, EX-L, and Touring. The most basic Accord LX features the 1.5-liter turbocharged engine, a continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT), Honda Sensing (see Favorite Features), push-button start, dual-zone automatic climate control, 17-inch alloy wheels, LED low-beam headlights, multi-view rear backup camera, 7-inch display audio with Bluetooth connectivity and auto on/off headlights. Moving up to the Sport trim brings the option of the 2.0-liter engine and manual transmission as well as standard 8-inch display audio, Sport combi seats, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility, a 12-way power driver’s seat, 60/40 split rear seat, and more.
In typical Honda fashion, options are allotted by trim. Moving up to the EX trim brings blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, a power moonroof, remote start, heated front seats and rear-seat air vents. The EX-L includes leather seats, a 450-watt audio system, and a 4-way power passenger seat. The Touring trim adds navigation (optional on the EX-L), full-LED headlights, head-up display, wireless phone charging, HondaLink Assist, heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, rain-sensing wipers, and front and rear parking sensors. Hybrid models pretty much match their non-hybrid counterparts, although there is no Sport trim.
Honda’s Accord sedan for 2018 offers a choice of two turbocharged 4-cylinder engines. Standard is the 1.5-liter turbo good for 192 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque, a 7-horsepower improvement over last year’s 2.4-liter engine. Optional on the Sport, EX and Touring is a 2.0-liter turbo pumping out 252 horsepower, a noticeable loss of 26 horsepower over the previous 3.5-liter V6. However, the 2.0-liter brings an additional 21 lb-ft of torque to the table, all of which is available at a much lower rpm. All trims with the 1.5-liter engine are mated to a CVT automatic transmission, with the exception of the Sport which offers a 6-speed manual option. The 2.0-liter is paired with Honda’s new 10-speed automatic, again the only exception being the Sport 2.0’s 6-speed manual gearbox. The 2018 Accord Hybrid employs the previous generation’s 2.0-liter gasoline engine and electric-motor setup, as well as the CVT transmission. 
  
1.5-liter turbocharged inline-4 (LX, Sport, EX, EX-L, Touring) 
 192 horsepower @ 5,500 rpm 
 192 lb-ft of torque @ 1,600-5,000 rpm 
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 30/33 mpg (CVT automatic), 29/35 mpg (Sport 1.5 and Touring, CVT automatic), 26/35 mpg (Sport 1.5, manual) 
  
 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 (EX-L, Sport, Touring) 
 252 horsepower @ 6,500 rpm 
 273 lb-ft of torque @ 1,500-4,000 rpm 
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 22/32 mpg (Sport manual), 22/32 mpg (Sport and Touring, automatic), 22/34 mpg (EX-L, automatic)  
  
 2.0-liter inline-4 + AC Synchronous Permanent-Magnet Electric Motor (Accord Hybrid) 
 212 combined horsepower @ 6,200 rpm 
 232 lb-ft of torque @ 0-2,000 rpm 
 EPA city/highway fuel economy: 47/47 mpg
The 2018 Honda Accord LX has a base manufacturer&#39;s suggested retail price (MSRP) starting at $24,445 including the $875 destination fee. The Sport 1.5 starts at $26,655 with either the manual or CVT transmission. The EX bumps the sticker to $28,345, while the Touring with the 1.5-liter engine tops out at $34,675. Add the 2.0-liter engine to the mix and the Sport jumps to $31,185, the EX-L to $32,845, and the Touring to $36,675. The new Honda Accord Hybrid also spans five trims, opening at $25,990 for a base model and rising to $35,600 for a Touring version. The Accord’s pricing is right in line with a comparably equipped Toyota Camry, Ford Fusion, Kia Optima and Chevrolet Malibu, and about $2,000 less than a comparably equipped all-wheel drive Subaru Legacy with EyeSight driver assist. Be sure to check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area paid. As for resale, it’s too soon to give accurate figures, but it&#39;s safe to say the new Accord will likely retain its excellent 5-year values on par with the Toyota Camry and ahead of just about every other midsize sedan.

                The 2018 honda civic electric vehicle qualifies for a federal tax credit of up to $7,500, effectively reducing the net base price.<br />
                <ul>
                    Depending on your city or state, other electric vehicle-related perks may include:
                    <li><span class=""bullet"">•</span> additional purchase incentives</li>
                    <li><span class=""bullet"">•</span> single-occupant access to carpool lanes</li>

                <br />
                Home charging stations, which cut charging times in half (or more) vs. standard wall outlets, may also be eligible for incentives. Find more incentive information at  <a class=""link js-fuelecon"" href=""http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxphevb.shtml"" target=""_blank"">

				<p>Stylish and filled with the latest tech and safety features, the 2018 Honda Civic is perfect for anyone looking for a spacious, fuel-efficient and reliable commuter car that’s fun to drive. Enthusiasts will like the 205-horsepower Civic Si Coupe or Sedan, and the 306-horsepower Civic Type R Hatchback is destined to become a legend.</p>

				<p>Despite its numerous body styles and powertrains, the Civic does not serve all. If you need all-wheel drive, look to a Subaru Impreza. For a diesel sedan or hatchback, turn to the Chevy Cruze. And if a hybrid is what you’re looking for, check out the Toyota Prius, Kia Niro and Hyundai Ionic.</p>

			<h3 class=""full-expert-review-section-header"">Driving Impressions</h3>
			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>Honda says its vast and longtime involvement in auto racing improves its street cars. Although it’s hard to draw a direct line from the Honda that won the 2017 Indy 500 to the new Civic, although both cars are turbocharged, a big part of the Civic's winning formula is the way it combines practicality, efficiency and everyday comfort with modest to maximum dashes of sportiness. The Civic is highly satisfying to drive, even a base model with the naturally aspirated 2.0-liter 4-cylinder and 6-speed manual transmission. The smaller but more powerful turbocharged 1.5-liter offers good if not blistering acceleration and nary a hint of turbo lag. Most buyers will choose the automatic transmission, and the Civic's CVT (continuously variable transmission) is among the best at mimicking a traditional one. A standard Civic can't quite match a Mazda3 in cornering dynamics, but it's still among the best in its class, as is its steering feel.</p>

			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>HONDA SENSING<br>
 This comprehensive suite of optional safety features and driving aids costs only $1,000. It’s an incredible value. The package includes adaptive cruise control with low-speed follow, road-departure mitigation, forward-collision warning, lane-keeping assist and the Collision Mitigation Braking System, which can automatically apply the brakes if a frontal collision appears imminent.<br>
 <br>
 HONDA LANEWATCH<br>
 Standard on EX, EX-L and the top Sport Touring trim levels, this clever system adds a camera to the passenger-side mirror to eliminate your blind spot. Every time you turn on the Civic’s right turn signal, the camera provides a live shot of the Civic’s flank on the interior touch screen.<br>

			<h3 class=""full-expert-review-section-header"">Interior</h3>
			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>The 2018 Civic’s interior is full of premium materials and top-notch plastics. Ergonomics is a volume knob shy of perfection, as using the new Honda Civic’s touch screen to crank up the Taylor Swift can be frustrating and distracting. This is a problem Honda has already addressed in other models. The large, easy-to-read screen also serves as the control center for audio, Apple CarPlay and the optional navigation system. The Civic boasts some of the best interior volume among compact cars. Rear-seat legroom is impressive in the sedan, but beware of the wide sills when entering and exiting. At 15.1 cubic feet, the Civic sedan's trunk is huge. Hatchback Civics boast 25.7 cubic feet of space with the rear seats up and some 20 additional cubic feet with them down.</p>

			<h3 class=""full-expert-review-section-header"">Exterior</h3>
			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>Honda took chances with the design of the 2018 Honda Civic and they have paid off. The Civic’s shape is daring and innovative, with an aggressive front end, a long, low and wide stance and unique C-shaped taillights. The Civic Sedan and Coupe feature elegant sloping rooflines, while the Civic hatchback stands out with its bulbous rear end, high-mounted spoiler and the gaping fake vents on either side of its rear bumper. Sport and Sport Touring hatchbacks can be spied via their center-mounted dual-exhaust outlets, while the new Si boasts its own edgier exterior cosmetics. The Type R gets a hood scoop, three exhaust pipes and a gargantuan rear spoiler.</p></div>

					<div class=""full-expert-review-section"">
			<h3 class=""full-expert-review-section-header"">Notable Standard Equipment</h3>
			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>The 2018 Honda Civic is offered in an array of trims that range from base LX to top Touring variants as well as the enthusiast-oriented Si and Type R halo models. The least expensive Civic LX sedan includes automatic climate control, rearview camera, folding rear seat, and a 4-speaker AM/FM audio system with USB port, Bluetooth connectivity and 5-inch screen. We think most buyers will prefer stepping up to at least an EX model, which includes an automatic transmission (optional on LX models), remote engine start, moonroof, 60/40-split folding rear seat and upgraded infotainment system with a 7-inch touch screen that is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatible.</p>

Other features vary with trim level, including leather interior, heated front and rear seats, navigation system, Honda's LaneWatch camera-based blind-spot monitoring system, power driver's seat, and dual-zone automatic climate control. One package we recommend for any Civic (as long as it has the required automatic transmission) is the Honda Sensing system. This suite of active safety features and driving aids described in &quot;Favorite Things&quot; is well worth the extra $1,000.</p>

			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>Two engines and two transmissions are used in the high-volume members of the 2018 Honda Civic. Base sedans and coupes use a 158-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder available with a 6-speed manual transmission or an excellent continuously variable automatic transmission. Higher trims and all 2018 Civic hatchbacks employ a 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that is more powerful and efficient. This engine can also be connected to a 6-speed manual transmission. Sport and Sport Touring Hatchbacks get a power bump. The Civic Si pairs its 205-horsepower/1.5-liter turbo engine with a 6-speed manual as does the Type R with its 306-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged engine. All 2018 Civics remain front-wheel drive, but while the baseline models burn regular unleaded gasoline, the Si and Type R require premium to exploit their full performance potential.<br>

			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p style=""text-align: center;"">The least expensive new Civic is an LX sedan with a manual transmission. Including destination charge, it arrives with a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $19,500. Civic coupes cost a few hundred dollars more, and the new hatchback Civic starts under $21,000. Top-line Civic models can reach the upper $20K range. While the Civic's starting prices aren't the lowest (the Ford Focus, Kia Forte, Hyundai Elantra and Mazda3 start less), they are in line with the Toyota Corolla. Both the Civic Si coupe and sedan share a $23,900 MSRP, with their sole option being a $200 set of “summer” performance tires (a fantastic value) and a wheel upgrade. The Type R starts around $35,000. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Honda Civic. As for the Civic's resale value, Hondas in general hold their value exceptionally well, and the Civic is no exception.<br>

Most buyers will choose the automatic transmission, and the Civic&#39;s CVT (continuously variable transmission) is among the best at mimicking a traditional one. A standard Civic can&#39;t quite match a Mazda3 in cornering dynamics, but it&#39;s still among the best in its class, as is its steering feel.
HONDA SENSING 
 This comprehensive suite of optional safety features and driving aids costs only $1,000. It’s an incredible value. The package includes adaptive cruise control with low-speed follow, road-departure mitigation, forward-collision warning, lane-keeping assist and the Collision Mitigation Braking System, which can automatically apply the brakes if a frontal collision appears imminent. 
  
 HONDA LANEWATCH 
 Standard on EX, EX-L and the top Sport Touring trim levels, this clever system adds a camera to the passenger-side mirror to eliminate your blind spot. Every time you turn on the Civic’s right turn signal, the camera provides a live shot of the Civic’s flank on the interior touch screen. 

The 2018 Civic’s interior is full of premium materials and top-notch plastics. Ergonomics is a volume knob shy of perfection, as using the new Honda Civic’s touch screen to crank up the Taylor Swift can be frustrating and distracting. This is a problem Honda has already addressed in other models. The large, easy-to-read screen also serves as the control center for audio, Apple CarPlay and the optional navigation system. The Civic boasts some of the best interior volume among compact cars. Rear-seat legroom is impressive in the sedan, but beware of the wide sills when entering and exiting. At 15.1 cubic feet, the Civic sedan&#39;s trunk is huge. Hatchback Civics boast 25.7 cubic feet of space with the rear seats up and some 20 additional cubic feet with them down.
Honda took chances with the design of the 2018 Honda Civic and they have paid off. The Civic’s shape is daring and innovative, with an aggressive front end, a long, low and wide stance and unique C-shaped taillights. The Civic Sedan and Coupe feature elegant sloping rooflines, while the Civic hatchback stands out with its bulbous rear end, high-mounted spoiler and the gaping fake vents on either side of its rear bumper. Sport and Sport Touring hatchbacks can be spied via their center-mounted dual-exhaust outlets, while the new Si boasts its own edgier exterior cosmetics. The Type R gets a hood scoop, three exhaust pipes and a gargantuan rear spoiler.The 2018 Honda Civic is offered in an array of trims that range from base LX to top Touring variants as well as the enthusiast-oriented Si and Type R halo models. The least expensive Civic LX sedan includes automatic climate control, rearview camera, folding rear seat, and a 4-speaker AM/FM audio system with USB port, Bluetooth connectivity and 5-inch screen. We think most buyers will prefer stepping up to at least an EX model, which includes an automatic transmission (optional on LX models), remote engine start, moonroof, 60/40-split folding rear seat and upgraded infotainment system with a 7-inch touch screen that is Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatible.
Climbing to the Civic EX-T in the sedan or coupe, or any Civic hatchback, brings the smaller but more powerful turbocharged engine as standard. Other features vary with trim level, including leather interior, heated front and rear seats, navigation system, Honda&#39;s LaneWatch camera-based blind-spot monitoring system, power driver&#39;s seat, and dual-zone automatic climate control. One package we recommend for any Civic (as long as it has the required automatic transmission) is the Honda Sensing system. This suite of active safety features and driving aids described in &amp;quot;Favorite Things&amp;quot; is well worth the extra $1,000.
Two engines and two transmissions are used in the high-volume members of the 2018 Honda Civic. Base sedans and coupes use a 158-horsepower 2.0-liter 4-cylinder available with a 6-speed manual transmission or an excellent continuously variable automatic transmission. Higher trims and all 2018 Civic hatchbacks employ a 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder that is more powerful and efficient. This engine can also be connected to a 6-speed manual transmission. Sport and Sport Touring Hatchbacks get a power bump. The Civic Si pairs its 205-horsepower/1.5-liter turbo engine with a 6-speed manual as does the Type R with its 306-horsepower 2.0-liter turbocharged engine. All 2018 Civics remain front-wheel drive, but while the baseline models burn regular unleaded gasoline, the Si and Type R require premium to exploit their full performance potential.

The least expensive new Civic is an LX sedan with a manual transmission. Including destination charge, it arrives with a Manufacturer&#39;s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of about $19,500. Civic coupes cost a few hundred dollars more, and the new hatchback Civic starts under $21,000. Top-line Civic models can reach the upper $20K range. While the Civic&#39;s starting prices aren&#39;t the lowest (the Ford Focus, Kia Forte, Hyundai Elantra and Mazda3 start less), they are in line with the Toyota Corolla. Both the Civic Si coupe and sedan share a $23,900 MSRP, with their sole option being a $200 set of “summer” performance tires (a fantastic value) and a wheel upgrade. The Type R starts around $35,000. Check the KBB.com Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Honda Civic. As for the Civic&#39;s resale value, Hondas in general hold their value exceptionally well, and the Civic is no exception.

					<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>The history of hybrid vehicles is marked by visually distinct or, some might say, weird-looking designs. The 2019 Honda Insight seeks to buck that trend. Born from the beloved Honda Civic, the Honda Insight merges a handsome sedan body with exceptional hybrid efficiency. Delivering up to 55 mpg in the city, the Insight’s sub-$23,000 starting price places it between the slightly pricier Toyota Prius and the slightly cheaper Hyundai Ioniq hybrid.</p>

			<h3 class=""full-expert-review-section-header"">Driving Impressions</h3>
			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>Whether propelled by its small gasoline engine, its torquey electric motor, or a combination of both, acceleration in the 2019 Honda Insight is seamless and perfectly adequate. Merging with freeway traffic is a worry-free affair, though hard acceleration does fill the cabin with droning engine noise. Consider that temporary soundtrack a small price to pay for outstanding fuel economy. The new Insight offers multiple drive modes that vary the throttle pedal’s urgency, while regenerative-braking intensity can be varied using steering-wheel-mounted paddles. The latter is a helpful feature that saves the driver from riding the brake pedal down long hills. As for suspension tuning, the Insight sedan absorbs road impacts with smooth sophistication. Coupled with a quiet cabin, competent handling and nicely weighted steering, the Insight is a top-tier commuter.</p>

 Hybrid cars use regenerative brakes to recapture kinetic energy as electricity. This technology improves efficiency but often results in a strange, wooden-feeling brake pedal. By contrast the Insight’s brakes feel wonderfully normal, allowing the driver to bring the vehicle to a smooth, imperceptible stop.<br>
 <br>
 8-INCH INFOTAINMENT SCREEN<br>
 Standard on the EX and Touring trims is a nifty 8-inch infotainment screen. This easy-to-use interface features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, and, unlike Hondas of the recent past, includes a volume knob as nature intended.<br>

			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>Like its Honda Civic cousin, the Insight offers generous passenger space and a roomy 15.1-cubic-foot trunk. Thanks to the hybrid battery’s placement under the rear seats, the Insight’s seatbacks fold to accommodate larger loads just like a normal sedan’s. Benefiting from standard active-noise cancellation and additional insulation in the hood, dash and fenders, the 2019 Honda Insight’s cabin is notably quieter than the Civic’s. It also looks fancier with real stitching and perforated leather seats appearing on higher trims. Meanwhile, a USB-adjacent phone tray and a large reconfigurable center console amplify the Insight’s practicality quotient.</p>

			<h3 class=""full-expert-review-section-header"">Exterior</h3>
			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>Even though it sprang from Honda’s excellent Civic platform, the Insight has distinct character of its own. Only the Civic’s roof and rear-quarter panels carry over unchanged; every other panel has been reworked to create the 2019 Honda Insight. And we like the results. Standard alloy wheels and LED head- and taillights impart a premium aura while understated “hybrid” badges merely hint at the hybrid technology that hides beneath. Otherwise, the Honda Insight looks like a normal, albeit attractively shaped, sedan.</p>

					<div class=""full-expert-review-section"">
			<h3 class=""full-expert-review-section-header"">Notable Standard Equipment</h3>
			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>In simplest LX trim the Honda Insight includes niceties like automatic climate control, a multi-angle rearview camera, power windows with an automatic up/down function, and a 5-inch color audio display. Strangely, the LX omits the external trunk release found in the higher EX and Touring trims. Impressively, the Honda Sensing suite of active safety features comes standard on all trims. That means even the cheapest Honda Insight offers advanced safety and convenience technologies like dynamic cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and forward-collision warning with automatic braking.</p>

For our money, the EX is the sweet spot in the lineup. Those craving heated leather seats, embedded navigation, a 10-speaker premium audio system, and a moonroof will find satisfaction in the top-level Touring trim.</p>

In olden days, the transition from electric to gasoline propulsion in hybrid cars was…conspicuous. Drive the latest Honda Insight and, aside from occasional engine drone at full throttle, the electric/gasoline wizardry is completely transparent. The 2019 Insight also features an EV mode that, under certain conditions, allows the driver to cover up to one mile using electricity alone.<br>

For $23,725 including destination charges (Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price/MSRP), you can buy a base 2019 Honda Insight LX trim. That’s about $500 less than the similarly efficient Toyota Prius and about $600 more than the more efficient but arguably less plush Hyundai Ioniq Hybrid. An even cheaper entry into the world of hybrids can be found in the roughly $21,000 Toyota Prius C. Alternatively, if fuel efficiency doesn’t rank among your primary concerns, a very Insight-like experience can be had for thousands less in its non-hybrid, mechanical forefather, the Honda Civic.

				""reviewBody"": ""The history of hybrid vehicles is marked by visually distinct or, some might say, weird-looking designs. The 2019 Honda Insight seeks to buck that trend. Born from the beloved Honda Civic, the Honda Insight merges a handsome sedan body with exceptional hybrid efficiency. Delivering up to 55 mpg in the city, the Insight’s sub-$23,000 starting price places it between the slightly pricier Toyota Prius and the slightly cheaper Hyundai Ioniq hybrid.
Do you want the money-saving benefits of a hybrid, but you’d rather not drive an eco-conscious statement piece? Then the tastefully styled Honda Insight could be the hybrid for you.
The Insight’s sedan body style lacks the hatchback functionality favored by many of its competitors. Beyond that, if you wish to project an image of “conspicuous conservation,” there are better choices. Hello, Toyota Prius!
Honda’s Insight is all-new for 2019.
Whether propelled by its small gasoline engine, its torquey electric motor, or a combination of both, acceleration in the 2019 Honda Insight is seamless and perfectly adequate. Merging with freeway traffic is a worry-free affair, though hard acceleration does fill the cabin with droning engine noise. Consider that temporary soundtrack a small price to pay for outstanding fuel economy. The new Insight offers multiple drive modes that vary the throttle pedal’s urgency, while regenerative-braking intensity can be varied using steering-wheel-mounted paddles. The latter is a helpful feature that saves the driver from riding the brake pedal down long hills. As for suspension tuning, the Insight sedan absorbs road impacts with smooth sophistication. Coupled with a quiet cabin, competent handling and nicely weighted steering, the Insight is a top-tier commuter.
REGENERATIVE BRAKES 
 Hybrid cars use regenerative brakes to recapture kinetic energy as electricity. This technology improves efficiency but often results in a strange, wooden-feeling brake pedal. By contrast the Insight’s brakes feel wonderfully normal, allowing the driver to bring the vehicle to a smooth, imperceptible stop. 
  
 8-INCH INFOTAINMENT SCREEN 
 Standard on the EX and Touring trims is a nifty 8-inch infotainment screen. This easy-to-use interface features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone connectivity, and, unlike Hondas of the recent past, includes a volume knob as nature intended. 

Like its Honda Civic cousin, the Insight offers generous passenger space and a roomy 15.1-cubic-foot trunk. Thanks to the hybrid battery’s placement under the rear seats, the Insight’s seatbacks fold to accommodate larger loads just like a normal sedan’s. Benefiting from standard active-noise cancellation and additional insulation in the hood, dash and fenders, the 2019 Honda Insight’s cabin is notably quieter than the Civic’s. It also looks fancier with real stitching and perforated leather seats appearing on higher trims. Meanwhile, a USB-adjacent phone tray and a large reconfigurable center console amplify the Insight’s practicality quotient.
Even though it sprang from Honda’s excellent Civic platform, the Insight has distinct character of its own. Only the Civic’s roof and rear-quarter panels carry over unchanged; every other panel has been reworked to create the 2019 Honda Insight. And we like the results. Standard alloy wheels and LED head- and taillights impart a premium aura while understated “hybrid” badges merely hint at the hybrid technology that hides beneath. Otherwise, the Honda Insight looks like a normal, albeit attractively shaped, sedan.
In simplest LX trim the Honda Insight includes niceties like automatic climate control, a multi-angle rearview camera, power windows with an automatic up/down function, and a 5-inch color audio display. Strangely, the LX omits the external trunk release found in the higher EX and Touring trims. Impressively, the Honda Sensing suite of active safety features comes standard on all trims. That means even the cheapest Honda Insight offers advanced safety and convenience technologies like dynamic cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and forward-collision warning with automatic braking.
In typical Honda fashion, premium features are accessed through higher trims. For a mere $1,200 more than the base LX trim the Insight EX adds smart entry with walk-away auto lock, 60/40-split rear seatbacks, a center armrest, remote engine start, Honda’s LaneWatch blind-spot camera, an external trunk release, and an 8-inch touch screen featuring Apple CarPlay and Android Auto smartphone integration. For our money, the EX is the sweet spot in the lineup. Those craving heated leather seats, embedded navigation, a 10-speaker premium audio system, and a moonroof will find satisfaction in the top-level Touring trim.
The Insight’s efficiency comes via a 1.5-liter Atkinson cycle 4-cylinder engine, a lithium-ion battery pack, and Honda’s 2-motor hybrid drive system. In olden days, the transition from electric to gasoline propulsion in hybrid cars was…conspicuous. Drive the latest Honda Insight and, aside from occasional engine drone at full throttle, the electric/gasoline wizardry is completely transparent. The 2019 Insight also features an EV mode that, under certain conditions, allows the driver to cover up to one mile using electricity alone.

                The 2019 hyundai elantra electric vehicle qualifies for a federal tax credit of up to $7,500, effectively reducing the net base price.<br />
                <ul>
                    Depending on your city or state, other electric vehicle-related perks may include:
                    <li><span class=""bullet"">•</span> additional purchase incentives</li>
                    <li><span class=""bullet"">•</span> single-occupant access to carpool lanes</li>

                <br />
                Home charging stations, which cut charging times in half (or more) vs. standard wall outlets, may also be eligible for incentives. Find more incentive information at  <a class=""link js-fuelecon"" href=""http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxphevb.shtml"" target=""_blank"">

				<p>If you’re seeking a compact sedan big on sophistication, quality and value, the 2019 Hyundai Elantra sedan is tough to beat. From its sleek body to its efficient engine range and high-tech features, everything about this sedan is designed to pull in buyers and never let go.</p>

			<div class=""paragraph-one"">
				<p>The Elantra isn’t as youthful or fun to drive as a Honda Civic or Mazda3, and unlike the Toyota Corolla, not every model comes with advanced driver-assist features. The hatchback GT doesn’t get the sedan’s new exterior treatment, leaving it looking a bit out of place.</p>

				<p>For 2019 the Hyundai Elantra sedan gets a major makeover, with a new front end, fenders, trunk and taillights. New driver-assist features are added to the SEL and higher trims, and the interior gets a number of upgrades including a rearview camera and, on Limited trims, Qi wireless charging.</p>

					<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>Just two years after launching an all-new model, the 2019 Hyundai Elantra gets an extensive makeover. The compact-sedan market changes quickly and Hyundai is determined to stay on top of the competition. Flying in the face of such radical designs as the Honda Civic, Mazda3 and Nissan Sentra, the updated Elantra takes a more sophisticated approach, placing an emphasis on style, luxury, safety and as always, an unbeatable 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. Beneath its seductive new skin, the Elantra remains unchanged, offering the same roomy interior, engines and suspension as before. Models range from the entry-level SE to the fuel-efficient Eco to the 201-horsepower Sport. The hatchback Elantra GT carries over with no changes, but likely will get an update in 2020.</p>

			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>The 2019 Elantra impresses, blending comfort, efficiency and even some sportiness. The standard Elantra's 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle 4-cylinder engine feels peppier than its 147 horsepower indicates, and its available 6-speed automatic transmission with Drive Mode Select is a willing partner. Whether romping around mountain 2-lanes enjoying the Sport mode's responsive steering and sportier shift patterns, or darting through city avenues where Normal mode provides smooth shifts and throttle response, we were impressed with the Elantra. For Green Party members, the Elantra Eco's gas-sipping 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder achieves a combined city/highway EPA figure of 35 mpg. And for party animals, the Elantra Sport rocks a 1.6-liter turbo delivering 201 horsepower and mated to either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. While the Elantra sedan and GT hatchback continue to use a torsion-beam rear suspension the Elantra Sport and GT Sport models raise the sport coefficient thanks in part to a multi-link rear suspension.</p>

Given how much our smartphones are now integrated with our cars, a wireless charging pad should be standard on every model. For now, you’ll have to settle for the plushness of the Limited trim to get a Qi charging pad, but you can say goodbye to that tangle of wires.</p>

Around back, a similar remake of the trunk, taillights and rear fascia coincides with new wheel designs on every trim.

			<div class=""paragraph-two""><p>The 2019 Hyundai Elantra SE base sedan with manual transmission has a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting just under $18,000. Move up to the nicely equipped Elantra SEL, and you're still looking at a price below $20,300. The Value Edition starts just under $21,300, while the Elantra Eco model will cost just under $21,900. Elantra Sport models start at $23,300. If you check all the boxes and go with a leather-lined Elantra Limited ($23,485) with the Ultimate package ($3,350), and you'll still be paying just $26,835 -- not bad for a mainstream car with more equipment than many entry-level luxury cars. Elantra pricing is close to that of the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, Mazda3 and Ford Focus. A Nissan Sentra starts below the Elantra, as does its own cousin, the Kia Forte. Check out KBB.com’s Fair Purchase Price to see what others in your area are paying for their new Elantra. The Elantra's resale value had traditionally trailed that of the market-leading Subaru Impreza and Honda Civic.<br>

				""reviewBody"": ""Just two years after launching an all-new model, the 2019 Hyundai Elantra gets an extensive makeover. The compact-sedan market changes quickly and Hyundai is determined to stay on top of the competition. Flying in the face of such radical designs as the Honda Civic, Mazda3 and Nissan Sentra, the updated Elantra takes a more sophisticated approach, placing an emphasis on style, luxury, safety and as always, an unbeatable 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty. Beneath its seductive new skin, the Elantra remains unchanged, offering the same roomy interior, engines and suspension as before. Models range from the entry-level SE to the fuel-efficient Eco to the 201-horsepower Sport. The hatchback Elantra GT carries over with no changes, but likely will get an update in 2020.
If you’re seeking a compact sedan big on sophistication, quality and value, the 2019 Hyundai Elantra sedan is tough to beat. From its sleek body to its efficient engine range and high-tech features, everything about this sedan is designed to pull in buyers and never let go.
The Elantra isn’t as youthful or fun to drive as a Honda Civic or Mazda3, and unlike the Toyota Corolla, not every model comes with advanced driver-assist features. The hatchback GT doesn’t get the sedan’s new exterior treatment, leaving it looking a bit out of place.
For 2019 the Hyundai Elantra sedan gets a major makeover, with a new front end, fenders, trunk and taillights. New driver-assist features are added to the SEL and higher trims, and the interior gets a number of upgrades including a rearview camera and, on Limited trims, Qi wireless charging.
The 2019 Elantra impresses, blending comfort, efficiency and even some sportiness. The standard Elantra&#39;s 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle 4-cylinder engine feels peppier than its 147 horsepower indicates, and its available 6-speed automatic transmission with Drive Mode Select is a willing partner. Whether romping around mountain 2-lanes enjoying the Sport mode&#39;s responsive steering and sportier shift patterns, or darting through city avenues where Normal mode provides smooth shifts and throttle response, we were impressed with the Elantra. For Green Party members, the Elantra Eco&#39;s gas-sipping 1.4-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder achieves a combined city/highway EPA figure of 35 mpg. And for party animals, the Elantra Sport rocks a 1.6-liter turbo delivering 201 horsepower and mated to either a 6-speed manual or a 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. While the Elantra sedan and GT hatchback continue to use a torsion-beam rear suspension the Elantra Sport and GT Sport models raise the sport coefficient thanks in part to a multi-link rear suspension.
POWER TRUNK, WITH A TRICK 
The Elantra’s trunk isn’t just power-operated; it’s smart enough to open itself. All that is required is you have the key fob somewhere on your person while standing behind the Elantra and after a few seconds, the trunk will open. 
 
QI WIRELESS CHARGING 
Given how much our smartphones are now integrated with our cars, a wireless charging pad should be standard on every model. For now, you’ll have to settle for the plushness of the Limited trim to get a Qi charging pad, but you can say goodbye to that tangle of wires.
