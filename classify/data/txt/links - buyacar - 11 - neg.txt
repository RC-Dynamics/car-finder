Fuel Economy
Environmental Information
A guide on fuel economy and CO2 emissions which contains data for all new passenger car models is
available at any point of sale free of charge*. In addition to the fuel efficiency of a car, driving behaviour
as well as other non-technical factors play a role in determining a car's fuel consumption and CO2
emissions. CO2 is the main greenhouse gas responsible for global warming.
* This guide is provided courtesy of Department for Transport; please see their link at the bottom of this page for applications.
