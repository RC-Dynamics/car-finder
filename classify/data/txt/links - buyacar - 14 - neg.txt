Fuel Economy & Emissions (Volvo XC60 2.0 D4 R DESIGN Pro 5dr AWD Geartronic
diesel estate)
Choosing a car with a high fuel economy can save you money and time - we've worked out how much this new car is going to cost to run in the first year along with the fuel emissions and fuel economy information so that you can compare it with other new cars.
Fuel Economy
Environmental Information
A guide on fuel economy and CO2 emissions which contains data for all new passenger car models is
available at any point of sale free of charge*. In addition to the fuel efficiency of a car, driving behaviour
as well as other non-technical factors play a role in determining a car's fuel consumption and CO2
emissions. CO2 is the main greenhouse gas responsible for global warming.
* This guide is provided courtesy of Department for Transport; please see their link at the bottom of this page for applications.
CO2 emission figure (g/km)
CO2 BANDA0g/km
Fuel cost (estimated) for 12,000 miles
A fuel cost figure indicates to the consumer a guide fuel price for comparison purposes. This figure is
calculated by using the combined drive cycle (town centre and motorway) and average fuel price.
Re-calculated annually, the current cost per litre is as follows - petrol 139p, diesel 147p and LPG 74p
(VCA March 2012)
Sorry we only have this information for cars using Petrol, Diesel or LPG
VED for 12 months
Vehicle excise duty (VED) or road tax varies according to the CO2 emissions and fuel type of the vehicle.
